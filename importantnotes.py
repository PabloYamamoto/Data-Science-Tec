# IMPORTANT for a coefficient to be statistical significant we want a p value less than 0.05.
# If all betas are 0, then none of the XÂ´s matter -> out model has no merit 
# The lower the F-statistic, the closer to a non-significant model


# Assumptions
# 1.- Linearity : each independt variable its multiplicated by a coefficient
# 2.- No endogeneity 
# 3.- Normality : Error is distributated. expected value is 0
# 4.- No autocorrelation : Co-variance of any two error terms in zero
# 5.- No multicolliearity : When two variables have a high correlation between each other
#
#
#
# LINEARITY 
# 
# Each independet variable is multiplied by a coefficeinte and summed up to predict the value of the dependent variable
# 
#
# NO ENDOGENEITY
#
# Refers to the prohibition of a link between the independent variables and the error mathematically expressed
#
#
# NORMALITY AND HOMOSCEDASTICITY 
#
# Normality : error normally distributated 
# Homoscedasticity : error term should have equal terms with others
#
#
# NO AUTOCORRELATION
